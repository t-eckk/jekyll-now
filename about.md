Whilst I was still a student, I dreamt of being involved within quantitative trading/investing. Models are elegant - as Emanuel Derman and Paul Wilmot would phrase, *"they serve to transform **intuition** about the future into a price for a security today"*, they *"combine the **qualitative** and the **quantitative**, **imagination** and **observation**, **art** and **science**"*.

Sadly, being involved in a Finance degree resulted in a lack of formal training, especially in Mathematics and Computer Science. Fortunately, university is only one of many ways of reaching literacy in a specific domain. The goal of this blog is to share some of my personal projects relative to quantitative finance. Most, if not all of them, will attempt to discover exploitable anomalies presented in an *academic-ish* way.

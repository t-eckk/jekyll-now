Whilst I was still a student, I dreamt of being involved within quantitative trading/investing. Models are elegant, as Emanuel Derman and Paul Wilmot would phrase, *"they serve to transform intuition about the future into a price for a security today"*, they *"combine the qualitative and the quantitative, imagination and observation, art and science"*.

Sadly for me, being involved in a Finance degree meant I lacked formal training, especially in Mathematics and Computer Science.
